    <h1>Yonsei Social Network & Neuroscience Lab</h1>
    <p><strong>Department of Sociology, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea</strong></p>

    <p>
        At Yonsei SNN Lab, we study how social networks, the brain, and health are interrelated.
    </p>

    <p>
        We focus on three main questions:
        <br>1. How do the social networks around us shape the human brain?
        <br>2. How does the brain enable complex human social networks?
        <br>3. How do the brain and social networks work together to affect our behavior and health?
    </p>

    <p>
        To explore these questions, we lead several research projects such as
        <strong>KSHAP</strong> (Korean Social life, Health, and Aging Project),
        <strong>KSAH</strong> (Korean Study of Adolescent Health), and
        <strong>KCWIS</strong> (Korean Child Wellbeing Index Survey).
    </p>

    <p>
        We take an interdisciplinary approach to integrate theory and methodology from
        medical sociology, social network analysis, social neuroscience, and machine learning.
