    bio: `Yoosik Youm is the Underwood Distinguished Professor of Sociology at Yonsei University, South Korea, where
he specializes in social network analysis, medical sociology, and social neuroscience. His research
investigates the intricate relationships between social networks, brain structure and connectivity, and
physical or psychological health outcomes across the lifespan. Professor Youm currently directs two
longitudinal studies: the Korean Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (KSHAP) and the Korean Study of
Adolescent Health (KSAH). KSHAP, initiated in 2011, examines sociocentric networks and biomarkers, including
brain MRI scans, among older adults in rural Korean villages, revealing insights such as the association
between social network positions and brain volume or connectivity. KSAH, initiated in 2021, focuses on high
school students in Seoul, exploring how social networks emerge through the co-evolution of social
connections and (dis)similar neural patterns. The study follows participants from their freshman year until
graduation across several waves of data collection. Professor Youm earned his Ph.D. in Sociology at the
University of Chicago and held faculty positions at the University of Illinois at Chicago before joining
Yonsei University.`,

M.S. and Ph.D. in Cognitive Science and Brain & Cognitive Sciences from Seoul National University. She
then worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Social Cognitive Neuroscience Lab at the University of
Chicago and the Social Neuroscience Lab at Pusan National University. Her research explores how social and

interests include health inequality, immigrant adaptation, gender, social capital, and quantitative methods.
In her doctoral dissertation, she conducted an empirical analysis using longitudinal data on multicultural
adolescents in Korea to examine patterns of social capital at the individual and family levels and their
relationship to health disparities. She has presented her research at domestic and international academic
conferences, including the Korean Sociological Association, the Korean Population Association, and
ANPOR-APCA. Her work has been published in SSCI journals such as the International Journal of Intercultural
Relations, Cross- Cultural Research, and Applied Research in Quality of Life. She holds a BA, MA, and PhD
from Ewha Woman’s University.`,

International Studies from Seoul National University, after which she worked as a researcher specializing in
Chinese economic policy. Recognizing the limitations of state and capital centered perspectives in
addressing lived social realities, she returned to Ewha Womans University to pursue an integrated M.S./Ph.D.
in Social Welfare. She is interested in the dual mechanisms of social capital and its role in both
exacerbating inequality and enabling policy intervention, with an emphasis on welfare policy design and
public welfare attitudes when implementing policies.`,

the life course. He also explores the neural foundations of social behavior and the social basis of brain
function by integrating socio-centric network analysis with neuroimaging. Recently, his work has focused on
the intersection of social science and artificial intelligence, investigating how AI can enhance social
research and how social data science can offer new insights to academia and society.`,
