      The Korean Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (KSHAP) is a long-running longitudinal panel study designed to
      comprehensively examine the social, emotional, cognitive, and physical health of older adults in Korea. Initiated
      in 2011 and ongoing for more than 14 years, KSHAP forms part of an international effort to understand aging and
      quality of life through comparative, population-based research. The study follows the entire population of older
      adults and their spouses residing in two rural Korean villages, constructing a complete community-based panel that
      enables detailed longitudinal and network-based analyses. KSHAP adopts a multidisciplinary research framework,
      integrating social network analysis, survey interviews, physical and functional assessments, biomarker collection,
      and structural and functional brain imaging. By combining rich social data with biological, neurological, and
      health-related measures, KSHAP provides a uniquely integrated perspective on how social relationships, emotional
      well-being, cognitive functioning, and physical health interact over the aging process. The project offers an
      exceptional research infrastructure for advancing theories of social aging, health disparities, and life-course
      processes, while also informing evidence-based policies and interventions aimed at improving the well-being of
      older populations.
